Customer Churn Analysis in Power BI


What is Customer Churn?

Customer Churn refers to the departure or discontinuation of customers or subscribers from a company or service. It is a crucial metric that companies seek to understand and predict accurately, particularly in sectors like telecommunications, as it directly impacts revenue growth. Identifying key indicators of churn is essential for implementing targeted strategies to reduce customer attrition.
By visualizing customer churn data, businesses can uncover trends, identify potential risk factors contributing to churn, and devise tailored strategies to mitigate churn rates and enhance customer retention.

Scenario

The dataset on Telco customer churn contains information pertaining to a fictional telecommunications company operating in California, serving 7043 customers during Q3. This dataset specifies which customers have terminated their services, remained, or newly subscribed. It includes various demographic details for each customer, alongside metrics such as Satisfaction Score, Churn Score, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) index.

Dataset Information

The dataset utilized for visualization is sourced from Kaggle and IBM's sample dataset collection. Each row represents a customer, with columns containing attributes described in the column Metadata. The dataset encompasses details regarding:
Customers who churned within the last month (indicated in the 'Churn' column).
Services availed by each customer, including phone, internet, online security, among others.
Customer account particulars such as tenure, contract type, payment method, billing preferences, monthly charges, and total charges.
Demographic information including gender, age range, and presence of partners and dependents.

Objective

The objective of visualization is to gain actionable insights into customer churn dynamics, pinpoint factors contributing to significant losses, automate analysis processes, and enhance overall data analysis efficiency.

Steps Taken

Data exploration: Analyzed the Telco customer churn dataset to understand its structure and contents.
Model design: Developed predictive models to forecast customer churn and identify key predictors.
Visual creation: Utilized Power BI to generate visualizations, including charts, graphs, and dashboards, to represent churn patterns, demographic trends, and service usage.
Insights extraction: Extracted actionable insights from the visualizations to understand the reasons behind customer churn and devise strategies for retention.
Automation: Incorporated automation techniques within Power BI to streamline the data analysis process and make it more dynamic and efficient.
Results interpretation: Interpreted the findings to identify competition as the primary driver of customer losses, alongside attitude and dissatisfaction factors, and geographical concentration of churn in specific areas. Additionally, the relationship between average churn scores and churn value was established.

Findings

Competition emerged as the primary driver behind customer losses.
Attitudinal factors and dissatisfaction also contributed significantly to churn rates.
Churn was concentrated in specific regions within Los Angeles and San Diego.
Customers not benefiting from specific offers exhibited higher tendencies to churn.
A clear correlation between average churn scores and churn values was observed.
